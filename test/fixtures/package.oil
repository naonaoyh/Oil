#test DSL to build a master schema for a suite of products - known in VPMS as a package
#the param is set to products - this is used to reference the current disk location of the products suite
#to be considered part of the package - in this case, all the products in the products dir
#can be extended in future to manage (for example) retail products, or office products, etc.
#in which case the disk store location or the local store might be either products/retail or products/office
